== Frequently Asked Questions ==  

= Does this work with ugly (?p=123) permalinks? =

No, this only works if you use pretty permalinks (/2011/01/01/post-name etc).
This is because the Facebook app needs to call the default location of fb_browse.php in the root of wordpress.
If not using Pretty links the system will not be able to detect it, and can't perform the redirect.
